      <p>
        We offer a wide variety of add-ons to our subscribers every week. 
        You can order all kinds of items like extra veggies and fruit, 
        bread, coffee, grains, herbs, milk, meat and cheese.
      </p>

      <p>
        Add-ons are charged at the same time as your box and delivered 
        with your box. They are a super convenient way to round out your 
        grocery shopping each week.
      </p>
